# **Docker Learning**

## *Docker is nothing but a platform for running,building and shipping containers.*

---

- Before learning docker it is very important to be crystal clear about the difference between two things that is *virtual machine* and *container*.

- **Virtual Machine**:Virtual machine is nothing an abstration of physical hardware. We can run several virtual machnes on a single physical machine. Suppose if you have a macbook machine you can run both Windows & Linux on top of it using a tool called hypervisor which is a software to create and  manage virtual machines.Some of commonly used hypervisors are Virtual Box and VMware.

- **Container**:A container is a nothing just an operating system virtualization.Technically it is just a process having its own file system.It is standalone unit of software that packages up code and all dependencies an application will require to run.
